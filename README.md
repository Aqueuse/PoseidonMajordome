# PoseidonMajordome
DataScience API generator : connect to any API, analyze the results with R and save time and space with MongoDB. All-in-one solution.

The final app will be a Java Desktop app who load a minimalist chromium browser and execute JavaScript to handle blockly and other code editors.
Java will also help to provide a backend storage with mongoDB and to create bundle app's and debug them with the wonderfull graalVM.
